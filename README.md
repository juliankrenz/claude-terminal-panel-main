## Features

- **Dedicated Sidebar Terminal** - Run any AI CLI tool directly from VS Code's secondary sidebar, always accessible while you code
- **Multi-Tab Support** - Run multiple terminal instances simultaneously with keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation
- **Prompt Notifications** - Visual indicator (pulsing red dot) when the terminal is waiting for your input
- **Native Status Line** - Claude's model, context usage, rate limits and working directory rendered at the bottom edge of the panel instead of as text in the scrollback
- **Resume Sessions in Place** - Continue or pick an earlier session in the current tab, without piling up new tabs

### Commands

| Command                                                     | Description                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Claude Terminal: Restart Terminal`                         | Restart the terminal session in the tab's own directory   |
| `Claude Terminal: New Terminal Tab`                         | Create a new terminal tab                                 |
| `Claude Terminal: Resume Session in Current Tab…`           | Restart the active tab with `--resume` and pick a session |
| `Claude Terminal: Continue Last Session in Current Tab`     | Restart the active tab with `--continue`                  |
| `Claude Terminal: New Terminal Tab (Resume Session…)`       | Open an additional tab with `--resume`                    |
| `Claude Terminal: New Terminal Tab (Continue Last Session)` | Open an additional tab with `--continue`                  |
| `Claude Terminal: Close Terminal Tab`                       | Close the current terminal tab                            |
| `Claude Terminal: Next Terminal Tab`                        | Switch to the next tab                                    |
| `Claude Terminal: Previous Terminal Tab`                    | Switch to the previous tab                                |
| `Claude Terminal: Add Editor Selection to Prompt`           | Put the selected code, or the open file, into the prompt  |

The four session commands only make sense for Claude Code. Claude stores its history per working
directory, so which sessions you get depends on the tab's directory — visible in the tab tooltip.

Access commands via the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`) or the view title bar icons.

## Prompt Notifications

The extension can detect when the terminal is waiting for user input and show a visual notification (pulsing red dot) on the tab. This helps you notice when your AI assistant needs attention, even when you're working in another part of VS Code.

### Built-in Detection Patterns

The extension automatically detects common prompt patterns:

- **Yes/No prompts**: `[Y/n]`, `(y/n)`, `[yes/no]`
- **Confirmation prompts**: `Confirm?`, `Continue?`, `Accept?`, `Proceed?`, `Apply?`
- **Interactive menus**: `❯`, `›`, numbered selections
- **REPL prompts**: `>`, `>>>`, `command>`
- **Claude Code hints**: Plan file prompts, "Would you like to" questions
- **General prompts**: "Press enter to confirm", "Esc to cancel"

### Custom Prompt Patterns

If your AI tool uses custom prompts not detected by default, you can add your own regex patterns:

```json
{
  "claudeTerminal.promptPatterns": ["^mybot> $", "\\[waiting\\]", "^Input: $"]
}
```

### Disabling Notifications

To disable prompt notifications entirely:

```json
{
  "claudeTerminal.promptNotification": false
}
```

## Status Line

For Claude Code tabs, the panel draws a status row at its bottom edge: model and effort, a context
bar with percentage and token count, the five-hour and weekly rate limits with their reset points,
the compaction counter, and the working directory.

It works without any setup. The data cannot be read from the terminal stream — Claude Code hands
model, token counts and rate limits only to the configured `statusLine` command — so the extension
ships a small producer and passes it to Claude per session via `--settings`. Nothing in
`~/.claude/settings.json` is changed, and the injection applies inside the panel only.

If you already have a `statusLine` command, it is not lost: the bundled producer runs it
afterwards with the same input, so its side effects still happen, while its text output is dropped
in favour of the native row. Set `claudeTerminal.statusLineProvider` to `own` if your script writes
the panel snapshot itself, or `claudeTerminal.statusLine` to `false` to switch the whole thing off.

Notes:

- The row updates when Claude re-renders its status line; a value older than a minute is greyed
  out.
- Tabs running something other than Claude Code have no status row.
- Claude's own colours (diff blocks and highlights) follow its `theme` setting, not the VS Code
  theme. On a light theme, pick a light theme in Claude too with `/theme`.

## Editor Context

Above the status line sits the file the editor is showing — `main.ts`, or `main.ts:120-134` when
you have code selected. The panel is next to your editor, so it may as well say what the editor is
looking at.

Clicking that row, or pressing `Cmd+Opt+K` / `Ctrl+Alt+K`, puts it into Claude's prompt:

- **With a selection**, the selected code goes in as a fenced block headed by `path:lines`.
- **Without one**, an at-mention of the file: `@src/main.ts`.

The difference matters more than it looks. An at-mention makes Claude read the entire file, and the
line numbers in it are only prose — measured on a 270-line file, 7422 bytes arrived for 120 bytes of
selection. Sending the selected lines sends the lines you meant; if Claude needs the rest, it can
read the file itself. Selections beyond 8000 characters fall back to the mention, where the file
reference is both smaller and easier to read than the quoted block.

The text is inserted, never submitted, and the caret moves to the terminal with it — the shortcut is
pressed with the focus in your editor, so without that the next thing you type would land in the
file you were just pointing at.

Notes:

- Nothing is attached automatically. Context leaves the editor only when you ask for it.
- Images, PDFs and other non-text editors are named too, but there is no selection to quote in them.
- `claudeTerminal.editorContext` hides the row; the command and its shortcut keep working.

## Custom Commands

Click the CLI icon button (next to the + button) in the tab bar to create a terminal with a custom command instead of the default.

### Command Input

When creating a custom terminal, you'll be prompted to enter:

1. **Command**: The CLI tool to run (e.g., `aider`, `gemini`, `opencode`)
2. **Arguments**: Additional flags and options

### Intelligent Flag Suggestions

As you type, the extension fetches available flags from the command's `--help` output and suggests them. This works with most CLI tools including:

- Claude Code
- Gemini CLI
- Aider
- OpenCode
- And any tool that supports `--help`

### Working Directory Selection

In multi-root workspaces, you'll be prompted to select which folder the terminal should start in. Each folder gets a unique accent color on its tab for easy identification.
