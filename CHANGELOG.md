# Changelog

All notable changes to the "Claude Terminal Panel" extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-05

Local fork, published nowhere: built and installed as `local.claude-terminal-panel-local`.

### Added

- Status line rendered natively at the bottom of the panel — model, effort, context bar, token
  count, session and weekly rate limits, compaction counter and working directory
- Bundled status line producer (`resources/panel-statusline.js`), handed to Claude Code per
  session through `--settings`, so the row works without touching `~/.claude/settings.json`
- `claudeTerminal.statusLine`, `claudeTerminal.statusLineProvider` (`bundled` / `own`) and
  `claudeTerminal.statusLineCompactBudget`
- `Resume Session in Current Tab…` and `Continue Last Session in Current Tab` — both in the view
  title bar, both respawning the active tab instead of opening another one
- `New Terminal Tab (Resume Session…)` and `New Terminal Tab (Continue Last Session)`, Command
  Palette only
- `claudeTerminal.cwd` to pin the working directory, `~` allowed — Claude Code stores session
  history per directory, so this keeps `/resume` showing the same sessions
- `claudeTerminal.preloadHelp` to opt into probing other CLI agents for `--help`

### Changed

- The terminal fills its column edge to edge; the remaining inset carries the terminal
  background instead of showing the page behind it as a frame
- Terminals follow VS Code theme changes live, including while the theme picker is browsed
- `Restart Terminal` respawns in the tab's own working directory rather than the first workspace
  folder, which silently changed which session history applied
- Tab tooltips show the working directory
- Help probing runs without a shell and only for command names matching `^[A-Za-z0-9._@/-]+$`;
  probing other agents is now off by default
- File links pointing outside the workspace and the terminal's directory ask before opening —
  terminal output is partly model-generated
- The webview nonce comes from `crypto.randomBytes` instead of `Math.random`

### Fixed

- The `.vsix` is installable on Intel and ARM alike. It carried only the `darwin-arm64` prebuild
  behind a `--target darwin-arm64` tag, so on an Intel machine the panel died at startup with
  `Cannot find module './prebuilds/darwin-x64//pty.node'`. All four prebuilds ship now —
  `darwin-x64`, `darwin-arm64`, `win32-x64`, `win32-arm64` — without a platform tag, 2.96 MB total
- `spawn-helper` ships executable. It arrived at 644 from `npm ci` and `vsce` stored that mode, so
  `pty.node` loaded and every spawn failed with `posix_spawnp failed`

### Added

- `scripts/verify-package-payload.js`, run as `prepackage` and `postpackage`: restores the
  executable bit, rejects an incomplete prebuild set, and keeps `.pdb` debug symbols (55 MB) out
- An editor row above the status line: the open file, plus the selected line range when there is
  one. Clicking it — or `Claude Terminal: Add Editor Selection to Prompt`, `cmd+alt+k` — puts the
  selected code into Claude's input as a fenced block headed by `path:line`, and `@path` when
  nothing is selected. A mention would pull the whole file: measured on a 270-line file, 7422
  bytes for 120 bytes of selection. Nothing is attached automatically;
  `claudeTerminal.editorContext` hides the row and leaves the command working

### Removed

- `@electron/rebuild`, `node-abi` and the `postinstall` script. `node-pty` 1.1.0 is N-API and
  therefore ABI-independent: the same `pty.node` loads under Node ABI 115, 141 and 146

## [1.0.10] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- Path autocomplete for command flags that accept file/directory paths
- Smart detection of path-accepting flags via value hints (`<path>`, `<file>`, `<directory>`, `<directories...>`)
- Hidden file support when user explicitly types a dot prefix
- Support for `~/` home directory paths with proper tilde notation in suggestions

## [1.0.9] - 2026-01-12

### Added

- Clickable file path links in terminal output

- Respects terminal's working directory for relative path resolution
